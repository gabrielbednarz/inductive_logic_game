# Inductive Logic Game

This game is an interactive way to learn and practice calculations for 
Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) using 
two tests, Test A and Test B, with given sensitivities and specificities.

You will be asked to calculate PPV and NPV for Test A and Test B,
given their sensitivities and specificities. The next four questions
of every round assume that either Test A, or Test B came back positive.
You have to calculate the updated PPV and NPV for each case.

For further information, refer to comments and code of main.py and calculations.py.
